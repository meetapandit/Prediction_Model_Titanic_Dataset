# Prediction_Model_Titanic_Dataset

We first build simple prediction models to predict survival of passenegrs using Titianic dataset

1. Logistic Regression and Bayes Logistic Regression
    -Assess the preformance using ROC curve

2. Feature Engineering
    -Add new predictors to the dataset

3. Again, test the performance using Losgistic Regression

4. Apply RandomForest classifier to classify observations

5. Conclusion: RandomForest performs better in classifying around 79% of observations accurately.
